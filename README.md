# The Big Picture - Mancala Game

Welcome to The Big Picture, an enhanced Mancala game that offers an engaging graphical user interface (GUI) and exciting features. In this project, I aim to provide an immersive experience by allowing users to choose between two popular Mancala games: Kalah and Ayo. My focus extends beyond gameplay, incorporating graphical elements and refining the existing codebase for improved object-oriented (OO) design.

## Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Immerse yourself in an interactive gaming experience with our visually appealing GUI, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless gameplay.

2. **Game Selection:** Choose between two captivating Mancala variants - Kalah and Ayo. Each game brings its own unique challenges and strategies to the table, ensuring a diverse and entertaining experience.

3. **Enhanced Gameplay:** I've added exciting features to elevate your gaming experience. Engage in strategic moves, experience improved graphics, and enjoy a more dynamic and enjoyable Mancala adventure.

4. **Code Refactoring:** My commitment to excellence extends to the codebase. I've refactored existing code to enhance the overall OO design, ensuring a more maintainable and scalable foundation for future developments.
